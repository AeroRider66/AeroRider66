- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AeroRider66 because I built planes, and I ride motorcycles.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in changing my career from engineer to software developer.  My software experience is at the assembly level.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, starting from nothing, planning to be the best I can possibly be.
- Plan is to learn the code, and make sure I have a good understanding of data structures and algorithms.
- 2nd steps are to branch out into other languages.


- ðŸ“« Reach out through GitHub if you have any suggestions on my path forward.  Thanks!
