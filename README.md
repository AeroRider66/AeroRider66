- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AeroRider66 because I built planes, and I ride motorcycles.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in changing my career from engineer to software developer.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, starting from nothing, planning to get as good as I can possibly be.
- Plan is to learn the code, and make sure I have a good understanding of data structures and algorithms.


- ğŸ“« Reach out through GitHub if you have any suggestions on my path forward.  Thanks!
